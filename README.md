# vagrant_ansibe_testing
Vagrantfile that spins up Ubuntu Box and uses Ansible for deployment

This is a Vagrantfile that spins up a Ubuntu Vagrant Box 18.04.03 and installs all thinks that are needed for using ansible
in the machine.

The Machine uses Virtualbox and ansible for the provisioning.

This repository and Vagrantfile should be a template if ansible playbooks and roles need to be developed or tested in a very
way.
